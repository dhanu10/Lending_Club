## General Information
- This assignment helps reenforce some of the concepts about linear regression and implement them in practice
- Data is provided from a bike sharig corporation which wants to boom the sales post-covid
- Business goal is to ramp up revenue by analysing which factors drive the demans 
- Dataset has past demand prior to covid with demand mapped to every day of 3 years along with other features like season, humidity, windspeed, tempratures etc.
- Goal is to build multiple linear regression model by choosing right features from the dataset

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Various methods like EDA, feature selection, multicolinearity assessment were used. Data was scaled and fit against regression model.
- windspeed, date of the year i.e. which in turn depends on season, and temprate best desribe and fit the regression model. 
- public holidays have little impact on demand
